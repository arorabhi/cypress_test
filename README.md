# 🚀 Cypress Test Automation for My Personal Website  

## 🌍 About This Project  

Hey there! 👋  

This is the **test automation project** for my personal website, which I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. To make it more robust, I wrote **end-to-end tests** using **Cypress**, ensuring everything works smoothly.  

I've also integrated **GitHub Actions** to run tests automatically, making the process efficient and hands-free!
